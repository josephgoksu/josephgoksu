I share practical insights from building internal platforms, automating delivery pipelines, and designing systems that serve both developers and end-users.

**Topics I cover**
- Developer Platforms as Products  
- Infrastructure as Code with Terraform and AWS  
- Kubernetes, GitOps, and multi-tenant architecture  
- Observability, incident response, and reliability culture  
- Balancing developer velocity with security and compliance
