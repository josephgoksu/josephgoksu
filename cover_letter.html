            <p>Hello,</p>

            <p>
              I am excited to apply for the role at your company. As a passionate Lead Software Engineer with extensive experience in fault-tolerant, highly available, well-crafted infrastructure and platform development, I believe I would
              make a valuable addition to your team.
            </p>

            <p>
              With my expertise in API design, low latency systems, cloud architectures, serverless and distributed systems, I am confident that I can make significant contributions to your organization. I have experience working at
              early-stage startups and in the Open Source space building products iteratively. Additionally, I have a Bachelor's degree in Computer Engineering from Ankara Yildirim Beyazit University.
            </p>

            <p>
              With a Bachelor's degree in Computer Engineering and experience working at early-stage startups and in the Open Source space building products iteratively, I have honed my expertise in API design, low latency systems, cloud
              architectures, serverless, distributed systems, and cloud migration. My programming languages include Rust, NodeJS (TypeScript), and Bash scripting, and I am proficient in tools and technologies such as Kubernetes, Terraform,
              Pulumi, CDK, Jenkins, Docker, and Amazon Web Services (including Fargate, EKS, Lambda, VPC, EC2, and more).
            </p>

            <p>
              In my current role as Lead Software Engineer at LexTego, I have successfully developed a robust cloud architecture that supported 300 transactions per second for a commercial product, built and managed an internal CI/CD
              platform capable of handling 50+ deployments per week, and designed a self-hosted client deployment architecture that reduced deployment time by 80%. I have also contributed to the development of five Node.js microservices,
              deployed and managed over 100 Lambda functions, and led a team of five junior developers to exceed project goals and achieve optimal performance.
            </p>

            <p>
              I am passionate about my work and always strive to stay up-to-date with the latest industry trends and technologies. As an AWS Community Builder and Microsoft Azure Community Hero, I am committed to sharing my knowledge and
              connecting with the technical community.
            </p>

            <p>I have included my resume for your review. Thank you for considering my application. I look forward to the opportunity to discuss my qualifications further.</p>

            <p>Sincerely,</p>

            <p>
              Joseph Goksu
