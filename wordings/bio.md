# Joseph Goksu - Professional Bio

Joseph Goksu is a Site Reliability Engineer with expertise in building resilient, scalable infrastructure at enterprise scale. He architects systems that eliminate single points of failure, implements comprehensive observability solutions, and drives automation that reduces operational overhead by orders of magnitude.

I stand on the shoulders of giants—and I believe in giving back. I contribute to open source not just out of passion, but because it's the right thing to do. I'm an AWS Community Builder and actively lead several communities where we cut through the noise, dig into real tech, and share what actually works.

My focus is where AI meets cloud infrastructure and developer workflows. I care about building things that actually solve problems whether that's smarter automation, more reliable pipelines, or systems that scale without wasting money. It's all about practical engineering, not hype.
